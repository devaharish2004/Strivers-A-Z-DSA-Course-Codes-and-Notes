Brute Force : 
Use another space (vector) to store all the elements of the LL and check if the vector is palindromic or not.
TC : O(N) + O(N) - one for storing and one for checking if it is palindrome.

Optimal approach : 
Two steps :
* Find the middle of the LL (take the leftmost if the length of LL is even) - using Floyd's algo
* Reverse the second half of the LL
* Move the pointer to middle+1
* Initialize a dummy node at the head and check if dummy == pointer till the end.
* If any one node is not equal - then return it is not a palindrome.
* If the pointer reaches null - means that it is a palindrome.

TC : O(N/2) + O(N/2) + O(N/2) - one for finding middle, one for reversing the second half and one for checking in both the halves.
Note :
If the interviewer asks to get back the original LL, then we can redo the same steps and that will take another O(N/2) + O(N/2) TC.
SC : O(1)
