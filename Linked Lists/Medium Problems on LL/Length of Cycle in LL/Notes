Brute Force : Hash map 
TC : O(N)
SC : O(N)

Optimal approach :
Use Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm - slow and fast pointers 
If there is a cycle, then both the pointers meet at a common point.
Traverse the LL once again from the common point until it reaches the common point again and increment the length variable.
Return the length variable.
TC : O(N)
SC : O(1)
