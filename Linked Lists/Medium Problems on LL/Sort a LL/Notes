Brute Force :
Iterate through the LL and store all the data in a separate data structure like arrays.
Sort it, and create a new LL or update the existing LL and return the head.

TC : O(N) + O(NlogN) + O(N)
SC : O(N)

Optimal approach : (using O(1) space)
Merge sort similar to array approach.
Find the middle of the LL and sort each half of the LL recursively.
TC : O(NlogN) 
SC : O(1)
