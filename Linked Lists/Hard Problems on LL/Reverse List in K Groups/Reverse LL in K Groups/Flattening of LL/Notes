Flattening of LL :
There will be child nodes for each node in the LL.
We have to iterate through the LL in each child and each node and sort the LL in such a way that :

* all the nodes are connected based on their child nodes and all their next pointers point to null.
* The nodes should be in sorted order.

We use an approach similar to the merge step in merge sort.

Intuition :
We know how to merge two sorted LL (by merge step in merge sort). We do it recursively for all the nodes and finally return the final LL.


We go till the end of the node (through the next pointer) recursively, and we merge the child nodes of the LL.
After merging, we get a single LL. 
Again we repeat the same steps till we reach the first node.
Finally return the head node.
