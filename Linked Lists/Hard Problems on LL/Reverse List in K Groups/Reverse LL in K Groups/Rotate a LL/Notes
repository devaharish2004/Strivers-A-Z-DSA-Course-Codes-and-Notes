Brute Force :
For each k, find the last node of the LL and make it as the first node of the LL.
TC : O(N*K)
SC : O(1)

Optimal approach :
Traverse through the whole linked list till the last node.
Make the last node's next point to the head pointer.
Traverse for N-K times in the LL.
Make the next node as head and break the next pointer of the current node as null.
Return head.

TC : O(N) (approx.)
SC : O(1)
