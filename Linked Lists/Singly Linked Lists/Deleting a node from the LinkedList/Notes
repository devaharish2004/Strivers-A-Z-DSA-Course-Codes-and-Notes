It is easy to solve if they provided the head value : Just go through the entire linked list and find out the node to be deleted - The code is provided.

What to do when the head pointer is not given and only the node to be deleted is given as the parameter ?

Then we have to rearrange the node given in such a way that it is not considered.
There are three steps :
* First, the value of the next node is copied to the given node's value.
* Then, the given node's next is changed  to the next node's next value
* Then, we can point the next node's next to nullptr and delete it.

 ListNode* temp = node->next;
        node->val = temp->val;
        node->next = temp->next;
        temp->next = nullptr;
        delete(temp);

Or, we can just
void deleteNode (ListNode* node) {
    auto next = node->next;
    *node = *next;
    delete next;
}
