Brute force :
Inorder traversal, store it in the vector/arraylist and use the two sum approach (two pointers approach).
TC : O(N) + O(N)
SC : O(N)

Optimal approach :
Using BST Iterator, finding the first and the last element and moving them accordingly (similar to the two pointer approach, here using iterators)
TC : O(N)
SC : O(H)+O(H)
