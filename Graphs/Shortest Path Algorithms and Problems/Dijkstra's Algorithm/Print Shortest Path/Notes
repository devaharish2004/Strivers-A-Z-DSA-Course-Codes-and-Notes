The shortest distance to the destination node will be found by the Dijkstra's algorithm.
But how to find the path it used ?

Intuition :
We have to remember the node from where the shortest path comes.

For this, we can use a parent array to find the parent of each node of where it come from.

Whenever we update the shortest distance for reaching a node, we push it in the priority queue and we update its parent node also.

Finally, we backtrack from the destination node, getting each of their parent node.

This order will be in reverse, so reverse the array to get the path.
