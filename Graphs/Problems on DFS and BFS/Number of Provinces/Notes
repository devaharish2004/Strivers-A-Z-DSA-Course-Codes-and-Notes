Disconnected components are traversed by moving through the visited array and checking if all the nodes are visited or not.
If a node is not visited, then we call the dfs/bfs function that will make sure that it will run through all the connected nodes to that node.
We can either use adjacency list or adjacency matrix to solve the problem.
The code contains both the variations.
