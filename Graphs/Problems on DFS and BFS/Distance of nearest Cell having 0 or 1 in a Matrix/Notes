Here, we use BFS to traverse levelwise in the matrix.
First we consider all the matrix elements that are 1 as the source nodes.
It is a multi-source BFS traversal.
We check for their adjacent elements and add them to the queue if they are not visited and they are zero.
When adding in the queue, we add them as row, column pairs with the steps taken to reach them.
Since, we complete all the elements in a particular step and move to the next step, we can ensure that it can be the minimum step to reach the zero.
(For example, in the queue, I will check for all the neighbouring elements which has a chance of taking 1 step to reach before going to 2 steps. So I can ensure that this is the minimum step possible)
