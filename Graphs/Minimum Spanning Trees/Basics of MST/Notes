Spanning Tree:
A spanning tree is a tree in which we have N nodes(i.e. All the nodes present in the original graph) and N-1 edges and all nodes are reachable from each other.

Note: Point to remember is that a graph may have more than one spanning trees.

All the above spanning trees contain some edge weights. For each of them, if we add the edge weights we can get the sum for that particular tree. Now, let’s try to figure out the minimum spanning tree:

Minimum Spanning Tree:
Among all possible spanning trees of a graph, the minimum spanning tree is the one for which the sum of all the edge weights is the minimum.

There are a couple of algorithms that help us to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph. One is Prim’s algorithm and the other is Kruskal’s algorithm.
