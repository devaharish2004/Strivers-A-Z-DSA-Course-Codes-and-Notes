Since we have to find the frequency and sort characters based on that, we can use map data structure to find the frequency.
Also, we have to sort the characters in decreasing fashion based on their frequency.
So, we can use a priority queue which will sort the elements in decreasing order (max heap).
Therefore, we can get the letters sorted in decreasing order based on their frequency. 
We use pair inside the priority queue to find which letter has the maximum frequency.
Finally, we traverse through the priority queue and add to our ans variable.
THE string() FUNCTION :
string(freq, char) - gives a string that has the char repeated freq times.
We use this function as the "+" operator in C++ is costly, so we try to reduce the usage of '+' operator.
