Problem Statement: Given two Binary Tree. Write a program to check if two trees are identical or not.

Approach: In order to check whether two trees are identical or not, we need to traverse the trees. While traversing we first check the value of the nodes, if they are unequal we can simply return false, as trees are non-identical. If they are the same, then we need to recursively check their left child as well as the right child. When we get all the three values as true(node values, left child, right child) we can conclude that these are identical trees and can return true. Any other combination will return false.

This can be solved using any traversal technique.

Just to be sure that the current root nodes' data must be same and then do the same thing for all the other nodes.
