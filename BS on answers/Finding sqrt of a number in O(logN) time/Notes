For Brute Force, Linear iteration

for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) //here n*n can be the maximum possible range a number can go (since 1X1 = 1)
Initially ans = 1 //since this can be the min possible ans

Optimal approach :
If, till a certain point the answer might be possible and till a certain point the answer is not possible, we can always apply binary search.

First, find the range of answers 
low = 1;
high = n;
 Eliminate one half by  checking the condition mid*mid <= n
True : Update ans and move low = mid+1;
False : move high = mid-1;
In binary search, either high or low will always point to the answer.
In this problem, high will always point to the ans. So, either return high or return ans.

Important Notes : 
Binary Search on answers : Always focus on the range of answers 

If to change the problem statement, find the maximum integer which on squaring will be <= n.

For all BS on answers, they will ask to find the minimum possible integer or maximum possible integer.

Pattern : 
If you are sure about the range of answers, and if they ask to find the max or min integer, always there exist a solution using binary search. 

Always use binary search and change the check condition within the binary search according to the problem.

Use long long int to avoid oveflow of the integer type.
