This is one of the hardest questions in Binary Search. It is of the type minimum(maximum) of Binary Search.
Also, we have to take only contiguous parts of the array.

THE RETURN -1 CONDITION :
When number of students > number of books, it's impossible to allocate books to all students.

SOLUTION :
BRUTE FORCE :
Finding the range can be useful in this problem.
If we take ans = 1 as the maximum can be assigned, we cannot assign a book that has pages > 1.
If we take ans = minimum of the array as the maximum can be assigned, we cannot assign a book that has pages > value.
If we take the maximum value in the array to be our answer, then we can be sure that each student will take a book.
Therefore, the lowest answer will start from the maximum value of the array.
We consider this could be our answer and allocate books such that the number of pages do not exceed the answer.
Whenever the sum of pages exceed the ans value, we can assign that book to a new student.

The high value can be the sum of the array, as the worst case can be one student assigned every books.
Do the linear search to find the answer.

TC : O(sum-max+1) * O(N)

OPTIMAL SOLUTION :
Binary search on answers.

Since initially low will be at the not possible area, it will finally point to the possible area. So, we can return low.

TC : O(log(sum-max+1))*O(N)
